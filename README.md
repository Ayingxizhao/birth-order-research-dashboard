# Birth Order & Cultural Gender Attitudes Research Dashboard

An interactive research dashboard exploring the relationship between birth order, cultural gender attitudes, and educational attainment in immigrant families.

## 🎯 Research Overview

This dashboard presents findings from research examining how birth order effects on educational attainment vary by gender and cultural background. The study analyzes data from 706 immigrant families with 1,098 children aged 18-35.

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Male Firstborn Premium**: Consistent +1.46 years across all cultural backgrounds
- **Female Firstborn Premium**: Varies from +1.75 years (progressive families) to +1.15 years (traditional families)
- **Cultural Heterogeneity**: Female firstborn effects decline with more traditional gender attitudes
- **Effect Size**: Large practical significance (0.64 standard deviations)

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### Interactive Visualizations
- **Regional Gender Attitudes**: Color-coded by cultural attitude levels
- **Family Size Analysis**: Tests for selection bias across firstborn genders
- **Education Distribution**: Density plots by birth order and gender
- **Effect Heterogeneity**: Interactive chart showing how effects vary with cultural attitudes

### Enhanced User Experience
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Interactive legends for all charts
- Export functionality for charts
- Responsive design for all devices

### Data Contribution
- Form for researchers to submit additional family data
- Structured data collection for ongoing research
- Real-time validation and feedback
